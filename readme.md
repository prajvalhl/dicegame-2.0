# Welcome to the Pig Game V2

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wishes. Each result get added to their CURRENT ROUND score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a `1`, all their **CURRENT ROUND** score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to **Hold** at any stage during thier turn, which means that their ROUND score gets added to their MAIN score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach winning score i.e 100 points on MAIN score wins the game.
